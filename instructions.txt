1) create a 3d screen
to implement 3d in our react app,we need to install a package
npm install @react-three/fiber
react three fiber is a react renderer for 3d screen
https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction
import {Canvas} from "@react-three/fiber";
canvas acts as a root component for entire 3d screen.all 3d objects and lights are rendered within this
canvas is a part of react three fiber library,a react renderer for threeJs
whenever we are rendering something inside a canvas it should be some 3d property.here loader code in not 3d.to convert it,we have to use 
react three drei which is an addition to react three fiber.it helps with cameras ,cpntrols
npm install @react-three/drei
import {html} from "@react-three/drei";
npm i @react-spring/three

use sketchfab for models.download glb and drag it to https://gltf.pmnd.rs/
